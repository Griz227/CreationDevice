# Introduction

  

This is a sample format Grok loaned me. I need to start writing, and I've been stuck on which path to take. So today I am taking the first step so I don't have to wonder which path to take anymore. It's time to start walking.

  

This is written in Markdown. It supports **bold**, *italics*, and [links](https://newsapi.org). Also - why am I not utilizing all these free #api s?

  

## Code Snippet

```javascript

console.log("Hello, webserver!");

 ```
