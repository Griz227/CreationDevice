# Purpose

The purpose of this document is to gather, organize, and articulate my thoughts. In a podcast I listened to recently by #CalNewport he gave some pointers on how we can become a serious thinker. I found it all very interesting, and between his prompts to write more, and Jordan Peterson's #JBP suggestion I've decided it's something I'm going to pursue - at least it whatever capacity I can muster.

So, without further ado, here is my 'idea document' about the recent and current events regarding the assassination of Charlie Kirk.

# Charlie Kirk

Here's what I've gather regarding Charlie Kirk.

- Charlie Kirk was assassinated by the mossad. 
	- Here's why I think that: In the recent days leading up to his death, (Sept. 10th, 2025 at UVU in Orem, Utah, Charlie had been starting to ask important questions regarding Israel. He started asking about stand down orders. He started questioning the feasibility of the October 7 conflict between Hamas and Israel. He started asking questions about 'ethnic cleansing'. He started losing money from Jewish and Zionist donors contributing to Turning Point USA - the million dollar organization Kirk built from the ground up. He started getting pressure from those same donors who reneged their support to cut ties from people in the media who were openly asking similar questions, like Tucker Carlson and Candace (Owens)?. 
	- In the immediate days following the assassination, YouTube received a multi-million dollar contribution from Israel - Netanyahu I'm not sure who exactly, but that seemed to be enough encouragement for YouTube to take down the recent video of live conversation between Kirk and Shapiro, where Kirk directly asked Shapiro (who also happens to be a Zionist and a Jew) about ethnic cleansing, and what was really going on in Israel. YouTube, or Israel, whoever the powers are that be, obviously needed that information scrubbed from the internet immediately? 
	- Why? Because Israel is hiding something. How long have they been hiding information? How long have they been influencing the way history is written? Were they truly the victims of WWII? The holocaust, the suffering Jews, etc... Maybe, just maybe, history didn't exactly happen the way we all were taught it did. 
	- Not to mention the pitiful story the FBI pulled together about the 'assumed assassin' being some kid from Southern Utah, who just happened to be dating/living with a male currently transitioning. And this kid supposedly shot Kirk with some old war rifle, and he magically broke down the rifle to fit in his back pack, and he magically reassemble the said rifle only to ditch it in 'a wooded area near campus wrapped in a towel'. Uh huh, sure. But the media doesn't want to talk about the private jet that turned off it's radar flying from the Provo airport (minutes away from UVU campus) to a major airport in Salt Lake City. No one wants to talk about how the explosion that killed Kirk seemed to come from the microphone attached to his t-shirt - NOT a bullet coming from the claimed '200 yards'. Who was it again that is known for detonating pagers? I guess technology has moved pagers now into smaller electronic devices, such as microphones. 
- Andrew Kolvet - he is the spokesperson for Turning Point USA. That dude is sketch. Don't trust him. I think it's weird they are continuing the 'Charlie Kirk Show'. They are tainting it with mistrust and the bad juju those boys are trying to cover up. 
	- I'm out of time for now. But that's a load off.
